# Morgan Treeman

This project was a collaboration between myself and two other devs for a school project. We worked under the guidance of our mentor who was available for questions and troubleshooting. 

The purpose of the website was to test our skills with React.

A simple visit to our fictional plant nursery site would go something like this: 

- The visitor can seach plants by name. 
    - Once the search is complete, they can select from a list of options listing name of the plant and a thumbnail. 
    - If selected, an accordian menu will open displaying a larger photo of the image and it's details.

- If the visitor selects 'Products' and would like additional information or to purchase any of the items listed, there is a button where they are then taken to a card displaying again, the photo and details but this time it includes the price of the plant and a box to add or subtract a quantity (we ran out of time, but the photo from the accordian, if clicked, was meant to take you to the products page where you could then see the card results and add it to your cart. Another feature we ran out of time to add was the search functionality to the products page.).

- The shopping cart has it's own drop down displaying a thumbnail with the name and quantity of the plant ordered, and the cart total.

    - The visitor has the option there to increase or decrease the quantity as well. 
- If the visitor exits out of the cart preview and initial plant card, they will see a 4 x 'infinate scroll' grid of other cards that also appeared in the search. 
    - Each card, before clicked, has a large photo of the plant, it's name, price, and the option to add it to your card.

    - If clicked, the viewer will see the card open into a modal with all the plant information.

- When checking out, it is a simple billing/shipping address form with the option to check a box to copy the address information over to avoid retyping.

## My Contribution

While we all took part in every aspect of the project so that we equally learned, I feel I contributed most in these areas: 

- Layout/Format/Styling of cards and modals
    - ProductModal.js
    - ProductCard.js
- Determining which items were brought in from the API and displayed
    - ProductDetails.js
- Putting together a standard footer
    - Footer.js
    - Footer.css

  We all contributed to the look and feel of the overall site, so in truth, I don't recall who did which css portions aside from the footer, only that we all took on the responsbility once we decided upon a look.

### What I learned

This project solidified that I truly LOVE being a developer. Through this project I feel these were the key lessons: 

- API's can open a lot of doors, but you do need to cross your t's and dot your i's for everything to play well together
- A high-functioning site isn't that out of reach, but to get there, it's best to have a clear plan and not just an outline
- If you think something deserves a score of a 2, score it a 3, or a 3 a 5... there are always unforseen challenges
- While I already knew this, it became even more evident: the best way to learn is to throw yourself into a project even if you don't know what to do
- Teamwork is not always easy no matter how much you like your team, or how agreeable you are
- A thorough retro is important to future success

It was fun to have so many tools at our disposal that we had to take a day to sort of reign it in since we were not only getting ahead of ourselves, but getting a little overwhelmed with the possibilities as well. This was the project I felt we became a real team! Projects since have been much easier, streamlined, and enjoyable.
