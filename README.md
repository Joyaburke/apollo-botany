# Apollo-Botany

This project was a collaboration between myself and two other devs for a school project. We worked under the guidance of our mentor who was available for questions and troubleshooting. 

## My Contribution

While we all took part in every aspect of the project so that we equally learned, I feel I contributed most in these areas: 

- Layout/Format/Styling of cards and modals
- Determining which items were brought in from the API and displayed
-
