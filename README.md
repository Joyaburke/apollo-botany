This project was a collaboration between myself and two other devs for a school project. We worked under the guidance of our mentor who was available for questions and troubleshooting. 

The purpose of the website was to test our skills with React. 

A simple visit to our fictional plant nursery site would go something like this: 

- The visitor can seach plants by name. 
    - Once the search is complete, they can select from a list of options listing name of the plant and a thumbnail. 
    - If selected, an accordian menu will open displaying a larger photo of the image and it's details. 
- If the visitor would like additional information or to purchase, there is a button where they are then taken to a card displaying again, the photo and details but this time it includes the price of the plant and a box to add or subtract a quantity. 
    - If added, that number will pop up in the top right in the shopping cart! 
- The shopping cart has it's own drop down displaying a thumbnail with the name and quantity of the plant ordered, and the cart total. 
    - The visitor has the option there to increase or decrease the quantity as well. 
- If the visitor exits out of the cart preview and initial plant card, they will see a 4 x 'infinate scroll' grid of other cards that also appeared in the search. 
    - Each card, before clicked, has a large photo of the plant, it's name, price, and the option to add it to your card. 
    - If clicked, the viewer will see the card open into a modal with all the plant information. 
- When checking out, it is a simple billing/shipping address form with the option to check a box to copy the address information over to avoid retyping. 

## My Contribution

While we all took part in every aspect of the project so that we equally learned, I feel I contributed most in these areas: 

- Layout/Format/Styling of cards and modals
    - ProductModal.js
    - ProductCard.js
- Determining which items were brought in from the API and displayed
    - ProductDetails.js
- Putting together a standard footer
    - Footer.js
    - Footer.css

  We all contributed to the look and feel of the overall site, so in truth, I don't recall who did which css portions aside from the footer, only that we all took on the responsbility once we decided upon a look.

### What I learned

This project solidified that I truly LOVE being a developer. Through this project I feel these were the key lessons: 

- API's can open a lot of doors, but you do need to cross your t's and dot your i's for everything to play well together
- A high-functioning site isn't that out of reach, but to get there, it's best to have a clear plan and not just an outline
- If you think something deserves a score of a 2, score it a 3, or a 3 a 5... there are always unforseen challenges
- While I already knew this, it became even more evident: the best way to learn is to throw yourself into a project even if you don't know what to do
- Teamwork is not always easy no matter how much you like your team, or how agreeable you are
- A thorough retro is important to future success

It was fun to have so many tools at our disposal that we had to take a day to sort of reign it in since we were not only getting ahead of ourselves, but getting a little overwhelmed with the possibilities as well. This was the project I felt we became a real team! Projects since have been much easier, streamlined, and enjoyable.
